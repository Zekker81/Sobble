  <h3>Things we currently know about him:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Sobble appears to be based on a chameleon. It has a fin on its head and a curled-up tail.</li>
    <li>Looks like it's somewhat timid Pokémon that shoots out attacks as it hides itself in the water.</li>
    <li>The Sword & Shield announcement trailer shows it camouflaging itself in a fountain, but runs off when Grookey approaches.</li>
    <li>It's the most popular starter from the ones introduced in Gen 8.</li>
  </ul>
